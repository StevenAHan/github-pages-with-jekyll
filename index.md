I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about myself and give context on who I am. First off, hello! My name is Steven Han. Here is a picture of me!

Below are a few things about myself to let you guys know who I am.

1) Playing the Piano

First of all, I enjoy playing the piano recreationally and even bought a small digital piano for home. I have been playing piano on and off for about 2 years now.

2) Volunteering at Raritan Bay

Furthermore, another fact about me is that I volunteered for Raritan Bay Medical Center in my junior year. I volunteered until I no longer could due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

3) Volunteering at Huaxia Chinese School

Finally, I also volunteered at Huaxia Chinese School located in East Brunswick. However, my volunteering activity had to also stop due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
